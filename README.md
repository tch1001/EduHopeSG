# EduhopeSG - A non-profit peer-to-peer consult project

[EduhopeSG's website](https://eduhopesg.com) frontend and backend code.

This is project EduHope, which hopes to leverage peer-to-peer consults to provide a
more affordable option for students.
It first started when we saw how the cheapest tuition rates go for tens of dollars
per hour, which means that many of us that are left out by the virtue of our inability to pay.

## Our belief

We believe in the power of free **peer-to-peer consultations** in creating a more affordable option for students.

We believe that the high cost of good-quality tuition puts many groups in society from getting
the support that they need in their studies - from students from underprivileged backgrounds
to others who may have been affected by the pandemic. Is that fair? Is that how it should be?

Additionally, we realised that many students do not require full-blown academic tuition,
such as high quality notes and prepared lessons. Sometimes, what we need is just a
friendly person to answer our occasional queries.

At the same time, we hope to create a way for those who want to give back but don’t have the time
to create detailed lesson plans and materials.

## Why should you volunteer?

Do you believe in our vision? Do you want to help people without spending so much time preparing materials? 
Then this is just the thing for you!
