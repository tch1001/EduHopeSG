# First-time setups

## Setting up the development environment

1. **Recommend** that node.js version is the current LTS version [v18.12.1](<https://nodejs.org/en/>)
for best compatibility and the least amount of bugs as it is written and tested in this version

2. Refer to `.env.example` and create a `.env` file **with the same format** at the same directory level
as `.env.example`

3. Download and install dependencies (including development ones).
   > **Note:** Run `npm install -g bunyan` to get the bunyan CLI on your PATH

   Download the following as global dependencies
   * Bunyan (optional)
   * Nodemon (optional)
   * Snyk (optional)

4. Setup the PostgreSQL database (using pgAdmin or another tool)
   By default:
   * Create the "eduhopesg" database owned by "postgres"/root account
   * Create a user "eduhope" with limited privileges in ONLY the said created database
   * Connect to the database as "eduhope" user and

5. Run `init_database.sql` to set up and create necessary tables and relations for PostgreSQL
with the necessary permissions and privileges to create tables.
You can also use `utils/database.js` and call the `setup()` function to initalise the database.

6. Then `npm run` to run

## Setting up the production environment

1. Use node.js current LTS version [v18.12.1](<https://nodejs.org/en/>)

2. `.env` or is correctly configured

3. Run tests before running the code

4. Setup PostgreSQL *USER ACCOUNT* and *DATABASE* <u>**respectively**</u>
   > <b><u><i>****WARNING/NOTE:</i></u></b> Connect to **TickNinja**'s database instead of creating a new
   > database as some tables are being referenced to it (subject, courses)
   > and other previous mappings

   ```SQL
   CREATE USER eduhope WITH
      NOSUPERUSER
      NOCREATEDB
      NOCREATEROLE
      NOINHERIT
      NOREPLICATION
      CONNECTION LIMIT -1
      PASSWORD 'xxxxxx';

   COMMENT ON USER eduhope IS 'User account for EDUHOPE.SG Production Database';
   ```

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS tickninja
      WITH
      OWNER = tickninja
      ENCODING = 'UTF8'
      CONNECTION LIMIT = -1
      IS_TEMPLATE = False;

   COMMENT ON DATABASE tickninja
      IS 'TickNinja x EDUHOPE.SG Production Database';

   GRANT ALL ON DATABASE tickninja TO eduhope;
   GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA public TO eduhope;
   GRANT ALL ON TABLE public.eduhope_user TO eduhope;
   GRANT ALL ON TABLE public.tutee_tutor_relationship TO eduhope;
   ```

5. Run `init_database.sql` to set up and create necessary tables and relations for PostgreSQL
with the necessary permissions and privileges to create tables.
You can also use `utils/database.js` and call the `setup()` function to initalise the database.

6. Then `npm run` to run
